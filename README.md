# S2V: A 2-Variable Visualization for TSNE Non-Profit Leadership Data

This is the code for the data processing, on-demand aggregation, and visualization of the [Third Sector New England Leadership in Non-Profit Survey Dataset]{http://tsne.org/leadership-new-england/}. The site that is currently live (for now) can be found [here]{http://web.mit.edu/~skoppula/www/tsne/index.html}.

For more information, please refer to the preliminary design document found [here]{https://www.dropbox.com/s/g6tcn5xdporimtj/code-for-good-design-doc-tsne.pdf?dl=0}

Note that due to data privacy concerns, the raw dataset required to replicate and run many of the scripts is not available publically. Please contact [sstlouis@tsne.org]{sstlouis@tsne.org} for information on how to obtain the dataset. 

Future work may include adding more variables to analyze, data reuse/performance improvements to the data aggregation server, and support for more types of visualizations.
